# Aim For The Stars



> You wake up bewildered and alone. In unfamiliar surroundings. A flashback throws you deeper into a black hole of confusion. Then a voice speaks «Welcome, Starseed..»



Narrative video game experience made as part of the [Global Game Jam 2021](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/aim-stars-0).

The game-jam lasted 48 hours, and we were a team of 4 people.

Our over-arching goal was to create a **feel**. Of course we also wanted it to look good, but we agreed that if we could convey some sort of emotion, we would be happy.

What we ended up with was a 10-minute experience about a person waking up in a space-ship that holds many secrets told through collectible audiologs and propaganda posters.
